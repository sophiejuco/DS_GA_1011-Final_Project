{"context": "My Father's Garden: Paragraph 1: [1] When I was a boy growing up in Delhi, India, we had a kitchen garden behind our downstairs apartment. My father was an avid gardener, he still is: and every Saturday morning he would put on his work clothes, pick up his hoe and trowel, and would head out the back door. 3 Paragraph 2: [2] As a ten-year-old, I was supremely unenthusiastic about swinging a hoe in the garden when I could be out playing with my friends. Having tried and failed,my father was unable to make a gardener of me. I had no qualms, of course, about enjoying the results of his labor: the potatoes, squash, cucumbers, and cauliflower that he pursued out of the earth. I would even help him dig out the potatoes or cut a cucumber from its vine. To me, it was much more fun to reap than sowing. Paragraph 3: [3] Many years later, living in an upstairs apartment, I am more often sorry I didn't follow my father out to the garden. I have several indoor plants, but the experience is not the same. The few times that I've helped a friend with yard work has given me the joy of touching the soil with an open palm, to get the earth under my fingernails, of patting down the berm around a newly transplanted sapling. Now that I live far from my father (I live in Iowa on the other side of the world), I wish I'd spend more time with him in the garden.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "Which of the following most clearly distinguishes between the \"two ways\" suggested by the author's assertion that \"we can't have it both ways\"?", "answerA": "Women haven't until recently been allowed to see the depths in Shakespeare, but nobody bothers to read Shakespeare anyway", "answerB": "Women haven't written as well as men because they've been too busy being spouses, but nobody takes time to read women writers anyway.", "answerC": "Women haven't written as well as men because they have not had the same educational opportunities, yet there are many great women writers no one reads.", "answerD": "Women have always had an abundance of Shakespeares, yet have not experienced the kind of education it takes to appreciate Shakespeare.", "correct": "C"}
{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "The main point made in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs is that the structure of a baby's brain:", "answerA": "is genetically determined before the child is born.", "answerB": "can be seen through positron-emission tomography.", "answerC": "can be altered through a process known as pruning.", "answerD": "is still developing after the child is born.", "correct": "D"}

{"context": "Unmanned spacecraft taking images of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa have found its surface to be very smooth with few meteorite craters. Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped. Cracks, dark bands, and pressure ridges (created when water or slush is squeezed up between 2 slabs of ice) are commonly seen in images of the surface. Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa. The heat generated by gravitational tides is quickly lost to space because of Europa\u2019s small size, as shown by its very low surface temperature (\u2013160\u00b0C). Many of the features on Europa\u2019s surface resemble features created by flowing glaciers on Earth. Large amounts of liquid water are not required for the creation of these features. If a thin layer of ice below the surface is much warmer than the surface ice, it may be able to flow and cause cracking and movement of the surface ice.

We'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door; we'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window, with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he's out there now, a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether, moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time. And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "According to the passage, one of the reasons some mental health and legal groups want to abolish the insanity defense is that:", "answerA": "even clever lawyers are confused about when to use and when not to use it.", "answerB": "juries that must sort out conflicting testimony become confused, and justice suffers.", "answerC": "when it is invoked, even if the case is won, the punishment often ends up being too lenient.", "answerD": "innocent defendants are too often being punished unfairly by unsympathetic juries.", "correct": "B"}

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "When she compares a baby's brain to city neighborhoods, the author is most nearly illustrating her point that:", "answerA": "neurotransmitters are actually brain chemicals.", "answerB": "regions of the brain are awakened through experience.", "answerC": "the visual cortex allows a baby to recognize specific images.", "answerD": "a baby's brain has about 1,000 trillion synapses.", "correct": "B"}

Father, mother, brothers\u2014we're all angled toward the television because something momentous is about to happen: the first man to walk on the moon. Paragraph 2: Somehow we're going to see it. We'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door; we'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window, with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he's out there now, a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether, moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time. And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. He does it, takes a little hop down onto that alien surface, the only man in the universe. Paragraph 3: Everyone is sitting quiet, watching, forks in midair\u2014I can see the profile of my father's jaw, my mother's small shoulders\u2014and just at that moment, I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate, to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves.

{"context": "The Men of Brewster Place: Paragraph 1: Clifford Jackson, or Abshu, as he preferred to be known in the streets, had committed himself several years ago to use his talents as a playwright to broaden the horizons for the young, gifted, and black\u2014which was how he saw every child milling around that dark street. As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone, even the young of Brewster Place, and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit, there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the world had waiting. No, it would not be a perfect world, but definitely one with more room than they had now. Paragraph 2: The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu, because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem. It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one-on-one out on the basketball court, but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two. Paragraph 3: Abshu wished that his own family could have stayed together. There were four of them who ended up in foster care: him, two younger sisters, and a baby brother. He understood why his mother did what she did, but he couldn't help wondering if there might have been a better way. Paragraph 4: Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care. The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills. And Mother Mason insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills, a more prestigious address than Summit Place. It was a home that was kept immaculate. Paragraph 5: But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat. She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches\u2014white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar\u2014and half an apple. Paragraph 6: When Abshu dreamed of leaving\u2014which was every day\u2014he had his own apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night. The Masons weren't mean people; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse. Paragraph 7: Abshu lived with these people for nine years, won a scholarship to the local college, and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop. By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home, but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there. One less mouth for her to worry about feeding. And after he graduated with his degree in social work, he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along. Paragraph 8: One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs. There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed. And church was mandatory. \"When you're out on your own,\" Father Mason always said, \"you can do whatever you want,but in my home you do as I say.\" No, they weren't mean people, but they were stingy\u2014stingy with their food and with their affection. Existing that way all the time, on the edge of hunger, on the edge of kindness, gave Abshu an appreciation for a life fully lived. Do whatever job makes you happy, regardless of the cost; and fill your home with love. Well, his home became the community center right around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him most fulfilled was working with young kids. Paragraph 9: The kids who hung out at the community center weren't all lost yet. They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework; and they wanted a safe place to hang. His motto was: Lose no child to the streets. And on occasion when that happened, he went home to cry. But he never let his emotions show at work. To the kids he was just a big, quiet kind of dude who didn't go looking for trouble, but he wouldn't run from it either. He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center. He made it real clear to them that this was his territory\u2014his rules\u2014and if they needed to flex their muscles, they were welcome to try.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "It may reasonably be inferred that James Merrill respected Elizabeth Bishop's poetry:", "answerA": "and wished that reaction to her poems had not been complicated by gender issues.", "answerB": "but was disturbed by her refusal to be included in women's anthologies.", "answerC": "but felt she should be more concerned with women's issues.", "answerD": "and was glad she was one of the four best women poets ever.", "correct": "A"}

Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped. Cracks, dark bands, and pressure ridges (created when water or slush is squeezed up between 2 slabs of ice) are commonly seen in images of the surface. Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa. The heat generated by gravitational tides is quickly lost to space because of Europa\u2019s small size, as shown by its very low surface temperature (\u2013160\u00b0C). Many of the features on Europa\u2019s surface resemble features created by flowing glaciers on Earth. Large amounts of liquid water are not required for the creation of these features. If a thin layer of ice below the surface is much warmer than the surface ice, it may be able to flow and cause cracking and movement of the surface ice. Few meteorite craters are observed because of Europa\u2019s very thin atmosphere; surface ice continually sublimes (changes from solid to gas) into this atmosphere, quickly eroding and removing any craters that may have formed.", "question": "Assume Scientist 2\u2019s view about the similarities between Europa\u2019s surface features and flowing glaciers on Earth is correct.
