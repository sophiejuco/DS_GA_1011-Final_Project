{"context": "Passage A: In Orbit: Paragraph 1: July 20, 1969: I'm running in a wide circle at the far end of the cul-de-sac, around and around until I settle in the dust under a thorny bush, but then my name floats into the game, calling me back as dusk descends on the neighborhood. Other names unfurl like ribbons, doors opening and closing\u2014Bobby, Brenda, Laura!\u2014and none of us kids even says goodbye, we just disperse, our small band so easily dissolved. I leave my perfect hiding place\u2014knees scratched, my hair smelling of sap\u2014to go back inside, where it's too hot and smells of stuffed cabbage, the television on to the evening news. Father, mother, brothers\u2014we're all angled toward the television because something momentous is about to happen: the first man to walk on the moon. Paragraph 2: Somehow we're going to see it. We'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door; we'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window, with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he's out there now, a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether, moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time. And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. He does it, takes a little hop down onto that alien surface, the only man in the universe. Paragraph 3: Everyone is sitting quiet, watching, forks in midair\u2014I can see the profile of my father's jaw, my mother's small shoulders\u2014and just at that moment, I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate, to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves. Everyone turns toward me: father, mother, brothers, angry, annoyed, and my father says well, thank you very much, and I know I've ruined it, this historic moment. Paragraph 4: I don't know why I did it: maybe I just feel vastly lonely, want to make my presence known, or maybe Ithought it would be funny, or maybe I was kind of applauding, the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down, shaking hands, mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning, they had done it, they had put a man onthe moon! My faux-pas just hangs in the air, the clank of the fork still hurting my ears. They turn back to the television, the set of their bodies so solidly against me,and I guess I don't really understand why it would be so great\u2014to be a man on the moon, exiled, in orbit so far from home. Passage B: On July 20th, 1969... Paragraph 1: Moon Landing Day\u2014we gathered before the television set to watch Apollo's final approach to the lunar surface. (And who ever imagined that we would watch the event as it happened, on television, in our homes?) \"Two thousand feet,\" Aldrin said, and Houston said, \"Eagle looking great. You're GO.\" With the incredible crawl-line at the bottom of the screen saying something like LIVE TRANSMISSION FROM THE MOON. Followed by long anxious moments as the landing vehicle drifted over the barren surface, moving between craters and a boulder field\u2014I am looking at the MOON, I told myself, I am looking at the MOON\u2014and then came the great plume of dust as touchdown approached, and then the words, the unforgettable words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\" Paragraph 2: Naively I thought that the hatch would now open, Neil Armstrong would come scrambling down the ladder, and within moments we would behold the spectacle of a human being walking on the moon. Well, no, there was all sorts of preliminary stuff to do first, hours of it, and throughout the rest of that afternoon and evening we hovered impatiently near the TV, and waited, and waited, and waited, and somewhere around eleven o'clock came word that Armstrong was about to emerge, and there was that foot on the ladder, and the dimly seen spidery figure descending, and then, step by step, the descent to the lunar surface, the arrival on it, the utterance of the somewhat bungled and stagy official First Words. Paragraph 3: I could hardly sleep that night. I could envision Luna City a-building a decade or two ahead, and the first lunar tourist trips, and then the first manned voyage to Mars somewhere around 1992, with all the rest of the universe just beyond.

{"context": "The Andean Panpipe: Paragraph 1: Whether its bright and jaunty or haunting and melancholic, the music of the Andes highlands has a mellow sound unique in the musical world. The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum. Paragraph 4: [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians' most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "The last paragraph suggests that those who would reevaluate, and perhaps want to devalue, the work of famous male poets should above all be:", "answerA": "cautious.", "answerB": "decisive.", "answerC": "opinionated.", "answerD": "zealous.", "correct": "A"}

{"context": "The Andean Panpipe: Paragraph 1: Whether its bright and jaunty or haunting and melancholic, the music of the Andes highlands has a mellow sound unique in the musical world. The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum. Paragraph 4: [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians' most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together.

We'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door; we'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window, with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he's out there now, a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether, moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time. And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. He does it, takes a little hop down onto that alien surface, the only man in the universe. Paragraph 3: Everyone is sitting quiet, watching, forks in midair\u2014I can see the profile of my father's jaw, my mother's small shoulders\u2014and just at that moment, I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate, to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves.

McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "One of the author's main points about the legal concept of responsibility in the passage is that:", "answerA": "the phrase \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" has made our legal system more efficient.", "answerB": "responsibility and guilt are legal concepts, and their meanings can be modified", "answerC": "knowing right from wrong is a simple matter of admitting the truth to oneself.", "answerD": "people can become severely disturbed without a word of warning to anyone.", "correct": "B"}

{"context": "The Andean Panpipe: Paragraph 1: Whether its bright and jaunty or haunting and melancholic, the music of the Andes highlands has a mellow sound unique in the musical world. The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum. Paragraph 4: [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians' most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced.

{"context": "Unmanned spacecraft taking images of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa have found its surface to be very smooth with few meteorite craters. Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped. Cracks, dark bands, and pressure ridges (created when water or slush is squeezed up between 2 slabs of ice) are commonly seen in images of the surface. Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa. The heat generated by gravitational tides is quickly lost to space because of Europa\u2019s small size, as shown by its very low surface temperature (\u2013160\u00b0C). Many of the features on Europa\u2019s surface resemble features created by flowing glaciers on Earth. Large amounts of liquid water are not required for the creation of these features. If a thin layer of ice below the surface is much warmer than the surface ice, it may be able to flow and cause cracking and movement of the surface ice. Few meteorite craters are observed because of Europa\u2019s very thin atmosphere; surface ice continually sublimes (changes from solid to gas) into this atmosphere, quickly eroding and removing any craters that may have formed.", "question": "Scientist 2 explains that ice sublimes to water vapor and enters Europa\u2019s atmosphere.

To see if solar power could provide a better alternative, engineer Kenneth Armijo and his team roasted batches of green chiles using between 38 and 42 heliostats, which are devices that concentrate sunlight. The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found that propane yielded faster results. While the fastest solar-roasted green chiles took six minutes, batches using propane took only four.

{"context": "The Andean Panpipe: Paragraph 1: Whether its bright and jaunty or haunting and melancholic, the music of the Andes highlands has a mellow sound unique in the musical world. The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum. Paragraph 4: [1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an antara, early musicians' most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced. [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes so that both sets are connected to the other set by a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together.

Father, mother, brothers\u2014we're all angled toward the television because something momentous is about to happen: the first man to walk on the moon. Paragraph 2: Somehow we're going to see it. We'll see Armstrong in his space suit emerge from the metal door; we'll see it as if looking through a scratched and dirty window, with blips and bleeps and static and a shimmering gray overlaying everything because he's out there now, a lone man in a different atmosphere altogether, moving backward down the ladder one slow step at a time. And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. He does it, takes a little hop down onto that alien surface, the only man in the universe. Paragraph 3: Everyone is sitting quiet, watching, forks in midair\u2014I can see the profile of my father's jaw, my mother's small shoulders\u2014and just at that moment, I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate, to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves. Everyone turns toward me: father, mother, brothers, angry, annoyed, and my father says well, thank you very much, and I know I've ruined it, this historic moment. Paragraph 4: I don't know why I did it: maybe I just feel vastly lonely, want to make my presence known, or maybe Ithought it would be funny, or maybe I was kind of applauding, the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down, shaking hands, mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning, they had done it, they had put a man onthe moon!

The Eagle has landed.\" Paragraph 2: Naively I thought that the hatch would now open, Neil Armstrong would come scrambling down the ladder, and within moments we would behold the spectacle of a human being walking on the moon. Well, no, there was all sorts of preliminary stuff to do first, hours of it, and throughout the rest of that afternoon and evening we hovered impatiently near the TV, and waited, and waited, and waited, and somewhere around eleven o'clock came word that Armstrong was about to emerge, and there was that foot on the ladder, and the dimly seen spidery figure descending, and then, step by step, the descent to the lunar surface, the arrival on it, the utterance of the somewhat bungled and stagy official First Words.

The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum.

Paragraph 2: The Vatican Museums house a great many valuable paintings, sculptures, pieces of jewelry, and tapestries, as well as the world's most extensive collections of ancient manuscripts. Scholars often probe the museums' archives of early written works for insights into lives led long ago. Paragraph 3: Accordingly, St. Peter;s Basilica, the largest cathedral in the Northern Hemisphere, is remarkable. Built upon second-century foundations. St. Peter's features a dome designed by the artist and architect Michelangelo. 10 Intricate mosaics\u2014enormous \"paintings\" fashioned from millions of tiny cut stones of various colors\u2014lining each of the basilica's several smaller domes. The marble floor, with its intricate designs, covers the cathedral's catacombs, where popes are buried. Sculptures by Michelangelo and Bernini, including Michelangelo's poignant Piet\u00e0, contributes to the basilica's beauty. Paragraph 4: However, to many, the most spectacular part of Vatican City is the Sistine Chapel. This vast chapel displays what many consider some of the most important works of Renaissance art: Michelangelo's awe-inspiring frescoes. These frescoes\u2014paintings made on freshly spread, still-moist plaster\u2014capture the attention of viewers with a complex array of religious images. One of his most famous frescoes, The Last Judgment, is painted on the west wall. A series of interrelated frescoes covers the vaulted ceiling.

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "The main point of this passage is to:", "answerA": "illustrate the importance of genetics in the formation of a baby's brain.", "answerB": "illustrate the importance of stimulation and experience in the formation of a baby's brain.", "answerC": "indicate the great need for conducting further research on babies' brains.", "answerD": "compare the latest research on babies' brains with similar research conducted fifteen years ago.", "correct": "B"}

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment.

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "The author feels that \"all this rating and counting and classifying of authors\" is:", "answerA": "an example of giving in to a competitive approach to literature, which the author feels is counterproductive.", "answerB": "an example of an approach to literature that feminists have supported and should continue to support.", "answerC": "at odds with Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism, a view that the author endorses.", "answerD": "important, especially if it helps eliminate the entire oeuvre of writers whose names contain double Ws.", "correct": "A"}

{"context": "The Men of Brewster Place: Paragraph 1: Clifford Jackson, or Abshu, as he preferred to be known in the streets, had committed himself several years ago to use his talents as a playwright to broaden the horizons for the young, gifted, and black\u2014which was how he saw every child milling around that dark street. As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone, even the young of Brewster Place, and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit, there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the world had waiting. No, it would not be a perfect world, but definitely one with more room than they had now. Paragraph 2: The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu, because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem. It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one-on-one out on the basketball court, but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two. Paragraph 3: Abshu wished that his own family could have stayed together. There were four of them who ended up in foster care: him, two younger sisters, and a baby brother. He understood why his mother did what she did, but he couldn't help wondering if there might have been a better way. Paragraph 4: Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care. The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills. And Mother Mason insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills, a more prestigious address than Summit Place. It was a home that was kept immaculate. Paragraph 5: But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat. She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches\u2014white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar\u2014and half an apple. Paragraph 6: When Abshu dreamed of leaving\u2014which was every day\u2014he had his own apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night. The Masons weren't mean people; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse. Paragraph 7: Abshu lived with these people for nine years, won a scholarship to the local college, and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop. By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home, but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there. One less mouth for her to worry about feeding. And after he graduated with his degree in social work, he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along. Paragraph 8: One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs. There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed. And church was mandatory. \"When you're out on your own,\" Father Mason always said, \"you can do whatever you want,but in my home you do as I say.\" No, they weren't mean people, but they were stingy\u2014stingy with their food and with their affection. Existing that way all the time, on the edge of hunger, on the edge of kindness, gave Abshu an appreciation for a life fully lived. Do whatever job makes you happy, regardless of the cost; and fill your home with love. Well, his home became the community center right around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him most fulfilled was working with young kids. Paragraph 9: The kids who hung out at the community center weren't all lost yet. They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework; and they wanted a safe place to hang. His motto was: Lose no child to the streets. And on occasion when that happened, he went home to cry. But he never let his emotions show at work. To the kids he was just a big, quiet kind of dude who didn't go looking for trouble, but he wouldn't run from it either. He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center. He made it real clear to them that this was his territory\u2014his rules\u2014and if they needed to flex their muscles, they were welcome to try. And he showed many that just because he was kind, it didn't mean he was weak. There had to be rules some-in their world, some kind of discipline. And if they understood that, then he worked with them, long and hard, to let them see that they could make a difference in their own lives.", "question": "Which of the following statements about the children entering the community center is supported by the passage?", "answerA": "They had unrealistic expectations that Abshu toned down in the course of informal conversations.", "answerB": "In Abshu's eyes, they were all gifted.", "answerC": "In Abshu's eyes, the children who were likely to succeed were the ones who gave him the most trouble at the outset.", "answerD": "They were prepared to believe in each other more than in themselves.", "correct": "B"}

Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped. Cracks, dark bands, and pressure ridges (created when water or slush is squeezed up between 2 slabs of ice) are commonly seen in images of the surface. Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa. The heat generated by gravitational tides is quickly lost to space because of Europa\u2019s small size, as shown by its very low surface temperature (\u2013160\u00b0C). Many of the features on Europa\u2019s surface resemble features created by flowing glaciers on Earth. Large amounts of liquid water are not required for the creation of these features. If a thin layer of ice below the surface is much warmer than the surface ice, it may be able to flow and cause cracking and movement of the surface ice.

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort.

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "The last paragraph suggests that the formation of synapses occurs most rapidly:", "answerA": "during the first two months of a child's life.", "answerB": "during the first nine months of a child's life.", "answerC": "from the time a child is about six months old until that child is about ten years old.", "answerD": "from the time a child is about one year old until that child is well into adolescence.", "correct": "C"}

{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "Which of the following best states the author's response to Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism?", "answerA": "It makes her reflect on why criticism is always so negative, yet she knows that most people don't read criticism.", "answerB": "It makes her uncomfortable because so many respect Matthew Arnold, yet she realizes his ideas about poetry are now irrelevant.", "answerC": "It makes her wonder who decides what is good, yet she knows most readers think they know what good poetry is and don't have time to read bad poetry.", "answerD": "It makes her question why more women don't read Matthew Arnold, yet she realizes that few women today would find Arnold's views engaging.", "correct": "C"}

The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up.

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "From information in the third and fourth paragraphs it can reasonably be inferred that the legal definition of insanity was changed in the 1970s after:", "answerA": "federal courts won a dispute with state courts over a proposal made by the American Law Institute.", "answerB": "the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse\" was found to contradict accepted notions of justice.", "answerC": "proponents of the McNaghten Rule had been using the insanity defense in far too many murder trials.", "answerD": "several courts found that justice was not always best served when the McNaghten Rule was applied.", "correct": "D"}

{"context": "Unmanned spacecraft taking images of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa have found its surface to be very smooth with few meteorite craters. Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped. Cracks, dark bands, and pressure ridges (created when water or slush is squeezed up between 2 slabs of ice) are commonly seen in images of the surface. Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa. The heat generated by gravitational tides is quickly lost to space because of Europa\u2019s small size, as shown by its very low surface temperature (\u2013160\u00b0C). Many of the features on Europa\u2019s surface resemble features created by flowing glaciers on Earth. Large amounts of liquid water are not required for the creation of these features. If a thin layer of ice below the surface is much warmer than the surface ice, it may be able to flow and cause cracking and movement of the surface ice. Few meteorite craters are observed because of Europa\u2019s very thin atmosphere; surface ice continually sublimes (changes from solid to gas) into this atmosphere, quickly eroding and removing any craters that may have formed.", "question": "According to the information provided, which of the following descriptions of Europa would be accepted by both scientists?", "answerA": "Europa has a larger diameter than does Jupiter.", "answerB": "Europa has a surface made of rocky material.", "answerC": "Europa has a surface temperature of 20\u00b0C.", "answerD": "Europa is completely covered by a layer of ice.", "correct": "D"}

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "According to the passage, a lawyer contemplating using insanity as a defense for a client should do which of the following?", "answerA": "Carefully evaluate using the defense, since in actual practice it rarely works", "answerB": "Assemble for trial a team of expert witnesses with a wide range of viewpoints on mental illness", "answerC": "Make sure that the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse\" is not used by the prosecution in his or her client's trial", "answerD": "Recommend that the client be acquitted because he or she has been judged criminally insane by a doctor", "correct": "A"}

Rather, they concluded that sediment influx in these streams may have been sufficiently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being observed.", "question": "Which finding about the streams in the study, if true, would most directly support Litty and Schlunegger\u2019s conclusion?", "answerA": "The streams regularly experience portions of their banks collapsing into the water at multiple points upstream of the sampling sites.", "answerB": "The streams contain several types of sediment that are not typically found in streams where the sorting effect has been demonstrated.", "answerC": "The streams mostly originate from the same source, but their lengths vary considerably due to the different courses they take.", "answerD": "The streams are fed by multiple tributaries that carry significant volumes of sediment and that enter the streams downstream of the sampling sites.", "correct": "A"}
{"context": "A Poem of One's Own: Paragraph 1: The time is overdue to admit that there is some-thing of a vacuum in women's poetry, and that we abhor it. For a woman to concede this is not disloyal to her sex; it's the first step in the creation of an environment in which women artists will flourish. But what can be done about the fact that the list of beloved women poets is not as long as the list of beloved poets who were born male? Paragraph 2: The most liberating response to the problem was the one Elizabeth Bishop chose. As James Merrill writes, \"Lowell called her one of the four best womenpoets ever\u2014which can hardly have pleased Miss Bishop, who kept her work from appearing in 'women's anthologies.' Better, from her point of view, to be one of the forty, or forty thousand, best poets, and have done with it.\" And he adds, \"If I raise the issue at all, it's to dissociate her from these shopworn polarities.\" For the working poet, moved by the sexless sunset or the sex-indeterminate beetle, the polarities are indeed shopworn, but perhaps as readers we may pursue the issue an inch further. For one thing that we can do about these two unequal lists is to read women poets of the past who have never been much read and to discover whether or not they deserve to be. Paragraph 3: Emily Dickinson, after all, would never have become one of the most revered poets in the world had her sister Lavinia not rescued her poems from the obscurity of a dresser drawer; and had her editor Mabel Loomis Todd not painstakingly transcribed nearly illegible scraps using a bizarre typewriter. Helen Hunt Jackson, that once celebrated, now forgotten poet whose work Dickinson herself admired, was another \"sister\" in this story, for she alone fully understood Dickinson's gifts. Jackson wrote to Dickinson urging her to publish: \"You are a great poet\u2014and it is wrong to the day you live in, that you will not sing aloud,\" her letter went. \"When you are what men call dead, you will be sorry you were so stingy.\" That has to be one of the most moving moments in American literary history. And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality. If we do the necessary work of reappraising the literary \"canon,\" and if we add some new women's names to the reading list, we will nonetheless have to settle for discoveries less dramatic than Lavinia Dickinson's, and we can expect them to appear with frequency. Paragraph 4: For the fact is that we can't have it both ways. We can't simultaneously espouse the line that women haven't until recently been allowed the depth of education and experience to become Shakespeare, while also claiming that we really have an abundance of Shakespeares, if anybody would just take the time to read us. Paragraph 5: But what is all this rating and counting and classifying of authors about anyway? If we set up one writer against another, aren't we giving in to what some feminists tell us is the adversarial mentality of patriarchal culture? We may think of Matthew Arnold's view of the function of criticism\u2014\"to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought\"\u2014and squirm in our chairs: Who's to say what is best, who's to say what is relevant? Paragprah 6: Theoretically, these questions are of some interest. Practically speaking, most of us who are habitual readers of poetry already have an answer. While acknowledging our profound differences of taste, we never doubt that there are good poems and terrible poems, and that the good ones are the only ones we have time for. Paragraph 7: What else can be done about the fact that the list of the best women poets is not as long as the men's list? In addition to looking closely for unjustly neglected women, one might question whether some men poets have been overrated. I think, for some reason, of poets whose names contain double Ws\u2014William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams\u2014and while I would be sorry to throw out the entire oeuvre of them, I confess that each of these poets has at times bored me to tears. Paragraph 8: The problem with taking men poets down a peg, however, is that it's hard to do so with discernment. The zeal to undo, immediately, the centuries of neglect and abuse endured by women poets has resulted in the devaluation of great poets who were born male and (farworse) in the devaluation of poetry itself.", "question": "Which of the following most fully lists solutions considered by the author to the problem that the list of beloved women poets is not nearly as long as the list of beloved men poets?", "answerA": "Reading women poets who have never been read, rejecting the writing of those whose names contain double Ws, and redefining what's good about the literary canon", "answerB": "Reappraising the literary canon, adding new women's names to the list, weighing the importance of some male poets, and reading work by women as yet not widely read", "answerC": "Questioning the importance of some male poets, encouraging readers to study women's journals, and creating a world in which women will flourish", "answerD": "Promoting the best work of current women writers, rediscovering older writers, reappraising Matthew Arnold's view of criticism, and acknowledging differences in literary taste", "correct": "B"}

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "The passage states that McNaghten wanted to kill the English prime minister because the Scotsman thought that he:", "answerA": "would establish a confusing legal precedent.", "answerB": "had been rejected by Peel's secretary.", "answerC": "would be better off in a mental hospital.", "answerD": "had been wronged by the minister.", "correct": "D"}

{"context": "The Men of Brewster Place: Paragraph 1: Clifford Jackson, or Abshu, as he preferred to be known in the streets, had committed himself several years ago to use his talents as a playwright to broaden the horizons for the young, gifted, and black\u2014which was how he saw every child milling around that dark street. As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone, even the young of Brewster Place, and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit, there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the world had waiting. No, it would not be a perfect world, but definitely one with more room than they had now. Paragraph 2: The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu, because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem. It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one-on-one out on the basketball court, but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two. Paragraph 3: Abshu wished that his own family could have stayed together. There were four of them who ended up in foster care: him, two younger sisters, and a baby brother. He understood why his mother did what she did, but he couldn't help wondering if there might have been a better way. Paragraph 4: Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care. The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills. And Mother Mason insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills, a more prestigious address than Summit Place. It was a home that was kept immaculate. Paragraph 5: But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat. She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches\u2014white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar\u2014and half an apple. Paragraph 6: When Abshu dreamed of leaving\u2014which was every day\u2014he had his own apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night. The Masons weren't mean people; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse. Paragraph 7: Abshu lived with these people for nine years, won a scholarship to the local college, and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop. By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home, but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there. One less mouth for her to worry about feeding. And after he graduated with his degree in social work, he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along. Paragraph 8: One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs. There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed. And church was mandatory. \"When you're out on your own,\" Father Mason always said, \"you can do whatever you want,but in my home you do as I say.\" No, they weren't mean people, but they were stingy\u2014stingy with their food and with their affection. Existing that way all the time, on the edge of hunger, on the edge of kindness, gave Abshu an appreciation for a life fully lived. Do whatever job makes you happy, regardless of the cost; and fill your home with love. Well, his home became the community center right around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him most fulfilled was working with young kids. Paragraph 9: The kids who hung out at the community center weren't all lost yet. They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework; and they wanted a safe place to hang. His motto was: Lose no child to the streets. And on occasion when that happened, he went home to cry. But he never let his emotions show at work. To the kids he was just a big, quiet kind of dude who didn't go looking for trouble, but he wouldn't run from it either. He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center. He made it real clear to them that this was his territory\u2014his rules\u2014and if they needed to flex their muscles, they were welcome to try. And he showed many that just because he was kind, it didn't mean he was weak. There had to be rules some-in their world, some kind of discipline. And if they understood that, then he worked with them, long and hard, to let them see that they could make a difference in their own lives.", "question": "It can reasonably be inferred from the first paragraph that in obtaining outside funding for the community center, Abshu could be characterized as:", "answerA": "thorough in seeking out potential sources for financial backing.", "answerB": "reluctant to spoil the children with charity.", "answerC": "excited about having the children write grant applications.", "answerD": "determined to let the children decide how the money would be spent.", "correct": "A"}

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years). Paragraph 6: Despite the current controversy, actual cases of acquittal by reason of insanity are quite rare. Jurors seem reluctant to believe that people are not morally responsible for their acts, and lawyers, knowing that an insanity plea is apt to fail, tend to use it only as a last resort. In California in 1980, only 259 defendants (outof approximately 52,000) were successful in pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.", "question": "The passage indicates that the McNaghten case became the basis for future decisions about legal insanity because:", "answerA": "the House of Lords upheld the verdict of the court despite considerable political pressure.", "answerB": "there had been an increase in cases of murder involving mistaken identity arising from delusions.", "answerC": "McNaghten was unable to convince the jury at his trial that he was incoherent and insane.", "answerD": "McNaghten used a gun to commit murder, thus aggravating the crime in the jury's mind.", "correct": "A"}

And then, right before his foot touches down in the dust, the words that will become an emblem: one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. He does it, takes a little hop down onto that alien surface, the only man in the universe. Paragraph 3: Everyone is sitting quiet, watching, forks in midair\u2014I can see the profile of my father's jaw, my mother's small shoulders\u2014and just at that moment, I decide to clank my fork on the edge of my plate, to make a loud noise that will penetrate the vast silence in which this man now moves. Everyone turns toward me: father, mother, brothers, angry, annoyed, and my father says well, thank you very much, and I know I've ruined it, this historic moment. Paragraph 4: I don't know why I did it: maybe I just feel vastly lonely, want to make my presence known, or maybe Ithought it would be funny, or maybe I was kind of applauding, the way the men in Houston must have been jumping up and down, shaking hands, mission accomplished after so many years of study and work and planning, they had done it, they had put a man onthe moon! My faux-pas just hangs in the air, the clank of the fork still hurting my ears. They turn back to the television, the set of their bodies so solidly against me,and I guess I don't really understand why it would be so great\u2014to be a man on the moon, exiled, in orbit so far from home. Passage B: On July 20th, 1969... Paragraph 1: Moon Landing Day\u2014we gathered before the television set to watch Apollo's final approach to the lunar surface. (And who ever imagined that we would watch the event as it happened, on television, in our homes?) \"Two thousand feet,\" Aldrin said, and Houston said, \"Eagle looking great. You're GO.\" With the incredible crawl-line at the bottom of the screen saying something like LIVE TRANSMISSION FROM THE MOON. Followed by long anxious moments as the landing vehicle drifted over the barren surface, moving between craters and a boulder field\u2014I am looking at the MOON, I told myself, I am looking at the MOON\u2014and then came the great plume of dust as touchdown approached, and then the words, the unforgettable words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\" Paragraph 2: Naively I thought that the hatch would now open, Neil Armstrong would come scrambling down the ladder, and within moments we would behold the spectacle of a human being walking on the moon. Well, no, there was all sorts of preliminary stuff to do first, hours of it, and throughout the rest of that afternoon and evening we hovered impatiently near the TV, and waited, and waited, and waited, and somewhere around eleven o'clock came word that Armstrong was about to emerge, and there was that foot on the ladder, and the dimly seen spidery figure descending, and then, step by step, the descent to the lunar surface, the arrival on it, the utterance of the somewhat bungled and stagy official First Words. Paragraph 3: I could hardly sleep that night. I could envision Luna City a-building a decade or two ahead, and the first lunar tourist trips, and then the first manned voyage to Mars somewhere around 1992, with all the rest of the universe just beyond. Who could have known that the beginning of all that was also the end, that all the glory of the space adventure was front-loaded, that we would attempt the journey, and succeed, and then stop?

And yet, and yet. Another reason many of us are devoted to Dickinson is that we love the romance of her story. Dickinson has to be one of the luckiest great writers who ever lived. She chose to live in isolation, which meant she was saved from the corruption of the literary crowd; no husband ever patted her head dismissively, no child ever interrupted her, and when her life was finished a team of disciples ensured her immortality.

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "The passage states that, in terms of development, the average baby should be able to:", "answerA": "focus his or her eyes on an object at two months of age.", "answerB": "develop a \"startle\" reflex at about two months of age.", "answerC": "make logical connections between ideas at about four months of age.", "answerD": "form explicit memories at about nine months of age.", "correct": "D"}

In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "As it is used in line 30, the phrase something innate most nearly means:", "answerA": "a memory.", "answerB": "learned behavior.", "answerC": "physical immaturity.", "answerD": "an inherited trait.", "correct": "D"}

{"context": "The Men of Brewster Place: Paragraph 1: Clifford Jackson, or Abshu, as he preferred to be known in the streets, had committed himself several years ago to use his talents as a playwright to broaden the horizons for the young, gifted, and black\u2014which was how he saw every child milling around that dark street. As head of the community center he went after every existing grant on the city and state level to bring them puppet shows with the message to avoid drugs and stay in school; and plays in the park such as actors rapping their way through Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Abshu believed there was something in Shakespeare for everyone, even the young of Brewster Place, and if he broadened their horizons just a little bit, there might be enough room for some of them to slip through and see what the world had waiting. No, it would not be a perfect world, but definitely one with more room than they had now. Paragraph 2: The kids who hung around the community center liked Abshu, because he never preached and it was clear that when they spoke he listened; so he could zero in on the kid who had a real problem. It might be an offhand remark while shooting a game of pool or a one-on-one out on the basketball court, but he had a way of making them feel special with just a word or two. Paragraph 3: Abshu wished that his own family could have stayed together. There were four of them who ended up in foster care: him, two younger sisters, and a baby brother. He understood why his mother did what she did, but he couldn't help wondering if there might have been a better way. Paragraph 4: Abshu was put into a home that already had two other boys from foster care. The Masons lived in a small wooden bungalow right on the edge of Linden Hills. And Mother Mason insisted that they tell anybody who asked that they actually lived in Linden Hills, a more prestigious address than Summit Place. It was a home that was kept immaculate. Paragraph 5: But what he remembered most about the Masons was that it seemed there was never quite enough to eat. She sent them to school with a lunch of exactly one and a half sandwiches\u2014white bread spread with margarine and sprinkled with sugar\u2014and half an apple. Paragraph 6: When Abshu dreamed of leaving\u2014which was every day\u2014he had his own apartment with a refrigerator overflowing with food that he gorged himself with day and night. The Masons weren't mean people; he knew he could have ended up with a lot worse. Paragraph 7: Abshu lived with these people for nine years, won a scholarship to the local college, and moved out to support himself through school by working in a doughnut shop. By this time his mother was ready to take her children back home, but he decided that since he was already out on his own he would stay there. One less mouth for her to worry about feeding. And after he graduated with his degree in social work, he might even be able to give her a little money to help her along. Paragraph 8: One thing he did thank the Masons for was keeping him out of gangs. There was a strict curfew in their home that was rigidly observed. And church was mandatory. \"When you're out on your own,\" Father Mason always said, \"you can do whatever you want,but in my home you do as I say.\" No, they weren't mean people, but they were stingy\u2014stingy with their food and with their affection. Existing that way all the time, on the edge of hunger, on the edge of kindness, gave Abshu an appreciation for a life fully lived. Do whatever job makes you happy, regardless of the cost; and fill your home with love. Well, his home became the community center right around the corner from Brewster Place and the job that made him most fulfilled was working with young kids. Paragraph 9: The kids who hung out at the community center weren't all lost yet. They wanted to make use of the tutors for their homework; and they wanted a safe place to hang. His motto was: Lose no child to the streets. And on occasion when that happened, he went home to cry. But he never let his emotions show at work. To the kids he was just a big, quiet kind of dude who didn't go looking for trouble, but he wouldn't run from it either. He was always challenged by a new set of boys who showed up at the center. He made it real clear to them that this was his territory\u2014his rules\u2014and if they needed to flex their muscles, they were welcome to try. And he showed many that just because he was kind, it didn't mean he was weak. There had to be rules some-in their world, some kind of discipline. And if they understood that, then he worked with them, long and hard, to let them see that they could make a difference in their own lives.", "question": "Which of the following statements about Abshu\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attitude toward his mother's choices early in his life is supported by the passage?", "answerA": "Abshu wishes he could get over the bitterness he feels toward her for allowing him and his siblings to be placed in foster care.", "answerB": "Abshu is worried that his mother is troubled by her decision to place her children in foster care and wants to comfort and support her now that he is a grown man.", "answerC": "Abshu wonders if she might have made a better decision about letting him and his siblings go into foster care, even though he understands why she did it.", "answerD": "Abshu wants to apologize for having been ungrateful as a child to his mother, who was only doing what she felt was best for her family.", "correct": "C"}

The instrument responsible for this sound is the antara, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once the more richer and more powerful empire in South America. Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up. The pipes, which can vary numerously from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before being bound to the other pipes. Paragraph 3: The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument have come from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the remaining tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand beat a cylindrical drum.

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "According to the passage, one thing PET allows neurobiologists to do is:", "answerA": "observe activity in the frontal cortex of a baby's brain.", "answerB": "determine the number of genes involved in the formation of a baby's brain.", "answerC": "control the release of neurotransmitters in a baby's auditory cortex.", "answerD": "restore microscopic connections in a baby's brain.", "correct": "A"}

Europa\u2019s surface ice shows evidence of being continually resmoothed and reshaped.

Two scientists express their views as to whether the presence of a deep ocean beneath the surface is responsible for Europa\u2019s surface features. Scientist 1: A deep ocean of liquid water exists on Europa. Jupiter's gravitational field produces tides within Europa that can cause heating of the subsurface to a point where liquid water can exist. The numerous cracks and dark bands in the surface ice closely resemble the appearance of thawing ice covering the polar oceans on Earth. Only a substantial amount of circulating liquid water can crack and rotate such large slabs of ice. The few meteorite craters that exist are shallow and have been smoothed by liquid water that oozed up into the crater from the subsurface and then quickly froze. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field, sweeping past Europa, would interact with the salty, deep ocean and produce a second magnetic field around Europa. The spacecraft has found evidence of this second magnetic field. Scientist 2: No deep, liquid water ocean exists on Europa.

{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "When the author refers to \"entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents\u201a\" she is most likely suggesting that new parents should:", "answerA": "give their babies products such as flashcards only if they have examined these products carefully.", "answerB": "not be deceived by advertising that claims certain products will increase a baby's intelligence.", "answerC": "not worry if their babies' development is slightly behind that suggested by neurobiologists.", "answerD": "take their pediatrician's advice before they listen to the advice given by other family members.", "correct": "B"}
