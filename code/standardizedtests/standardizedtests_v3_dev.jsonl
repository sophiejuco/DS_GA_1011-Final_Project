{"context": "How to Build a Baby's Brain: Paragraph 1: You cannot see what is going on inside your new-born's brain. You cannot see the electrical activity as her eyes lock onto yours and, almost instantaneously, a neuron in her retina makes a connection to one in her brain's visual cortex that will last all her life. The image of your face has become an enduring memory inher mind. And you cannot see the explosive release of a neurotransmitter\u2014brain chemical\u2014as a neuron from your baby's ear, carrying the electrically encoded sound of \"ma,\" connects to a neuron in her auditory cortex. \"Ma\" has now commandeered a cluster of cells in the infant's brain that will, as long as the child lives, respond to no other sound. Paragraph 2: You cannot see any of this. But Dr. Harry Chugani can come close. With positron-emission tomography (PET), Chugani, a pediatric neurobiologist, watches the regions of a baby's brain turn on, one after another, like city neighborhoods having their electricity restored after a blackout. He can measure activity in the primitive brain stem and sensory cortex from the moment the baby is born. He can observe the visual cortex burn with activity in the second and third months of life. He can see the frontal cortex light up at 6 to 8 months. He can see, in other words, that the brain of a baby is still forming long after the child has left the womb\u2014not merely growing bigger, but forming the microscopic connections responsible for feeling, learning and remembering. Paragraph 3: Scientists are just now realizing how experiences after birth, rather than something innate, determine the actual wiring of the human brain. Only 15 years ago neuroscientists assumed that by the time babies are born, the structure of their brains had been genetically determined. But by 1996, researchers knew that was wrong. Instead, early-childhood experiences exert a dramatic and precise impact, physically determining how the intricate neural circuits of the brain are wired. Since then they have been learning how those experiences shape the brain's circuits. Paragraph 4: At birth, the brain's 100 billion or so neurons form more than 50 trillion connections (synapses). The genes the baby carries have already determined his brain's basic wiring. They have formed the connections in the brain stem that will make the heart beat and the lungs respire. But that's not all. Of a human's 80,000 different genes, fully half are believed to be involved in forming and running the central nervous system. Yet even that doesn't come close to what the brain needs. In the first months of life, the number of synapses will increase 20-50 fold\u2014to more than 1,000 trillion. There simply are not enough genes in the human species to specify so many connections. Paragraph 5: That leaves experience\u2014all the signals that a baby receives from the world. Experience seems to exert its effects by strengthening synapses. Just as a memory will fade if it is not accessed from time to time, so synapses that are not used will also wither away in a process called pruning. The way to reinforce these wispy connections has come to be known as stimulation. Contrary to the claims of entrepreneurs preying on the anxieties of new parents, stimulation does not mean subjecting a toddler to flashcards. Rather, it is something much simpler\u2014sorting socks by color or listening to the soothing cadences of a fairy tale. In the most extensive study yet of what makes a difference, Craig Ramey of the University of Alabama found that it was blocks, beads, peekaboo and other old-fashioned measures that enhance cognitive, motor and language development\u2014and, absent traumas, enhance them permanently. Paragraph 6: The formation of synapses (synaptogenesis) and their pruning occurs at different times in different parts of the brain. The sequence seems to coincide with the emergence of various skills. Synaptogenesis begins in the motor cortex at about 2 months. Around then, infants lose their \"startle\" and \"rooting\" reflexes and begin to master purposeful movements. At 3 months, synapse formation in the visual cortex peaks; the brainis fine-tuning connections allowing the eyes to focus on an object. At 8 or 9 months the hippocampus, which indexes and files memories, becomes fully functional; only now can babies form explicit memories of, say, how to move a mobile. In the second half of the first year, finds Chugani, the prefrontal cortex, the seat of forethought and logic, forms synapses at such a rate that it consumes twice as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's first decade of life.", "question": "The fifth paragraph suggests that one of the main causes of pruning is:", "answerA": "a lack of stimulation.", "answerB": "an insufficient number of genes.", "answerC": "the use of flashcards.", "answerD": "the strengthening of synapses.", "correct": "A"}

Paragraph 2: The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, which are then lined up.

{"context": "Personality Disorders: Paragraph 1: How should the law treat a mentally disturbed person who commits a criminal offense? Should individuals whose mental faculties are impaired be held responsible for their actions? These questions are of concern to social scientists, to members of the legal profession, and to individuals who work with criminal offenders. Paragraph 2: Over the centuries, an important part of Western law has been the concept that a civilized society should not punish a person who is mentally incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In 1724, an English court maintained that a man was not responsible for an act if \"he doth not know what he is doing, no more than . . . awild beast.\" Modern standards of legal responsibility, however, have been based on the McNaghten decision of 1843. McNaghten, a Scotsman, suffered the paranoid delusion that he was being persecuted by the English prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. In an attempt to kill Peel, he mistakenly shot Peel's secretary. Everyone involved in the trial was convinced by McNaghten's senseless ramblings that he was insane. He was judged not responsible by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital, where he remained until his death. But Queen Victoria was not pleased with the verdict\u2014apparently she felt that political assassinations should not be taken lightly\u2014and called on the House of Lords to review the decision. The decision was upheld and rules for the legal definition of insanity were put into writing. The McNaghten Rule states that a defendant may be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" only if he were so severely disturbed at the time of his act that he did not know what he was doing, or that if he did know what he was doing, he did not know it was wrong. Paragraph 3: The McNaghten Rule was adopted in the United States, and the distinction of knowing right from wrong remained the basis of most decisions of legal insanity for over a century. Some states added to their statutes the doctrine of \"irresistible impulse,\" which recognizes that some mentally ill individuals may respond correctly when asked if a particular act is morally right or wrong but still be unable to control their behavior. Paragraph 4: During the 1970s, a number of state and federal courts adopted a broader legal definition of insanity proposed by the American Law Institute, which states: \"A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\" The word substantial suggests that \"any\" incapacity is not enough to avoid criminal responsibility but that \"total\" incapacityis not required either. The use of the word appreciate rather than know implies that intellectual awareness of right or wrong is not enough; individuals must have some understanding of the moral or legal consequencesof their behavior before they can be held criminally responsible. Paragraph 5: The problem of legal responsibility in the case of mentally disordered individuals is currently a topic of intense debate, and a number of legal and mental health professionals have recommended abolishing the insanity plea as a defense. The reasons for this recommendation are varied. Many experts believe that the current courtroom procedures\u2014in which psychiatrists and psychologists for the prosecution and the defense present contradictory evidence as to the defendant's mental state\u2014are confusing to the jury and do little to help the cause of justice. Some also argue that the abuse of the insanity plea by clever lawyers has allowed too many criminals to escape conviction. Others claim that acquittal by reason of insanity often leads to a worse punishment (an indeterminate sentenceto an institution for the criminally insane that may confine a person for life) than being convicted and sent to prison (with the possibility of parole in a few years).

{"context": "To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps\u2019 burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow\u2019s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that\u2019s impossible with resin casting because \u2026", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "answerA": "it can only be used on burrows below a certain size.", "answerB": "it does not allow for multiple castings of the same burrow over time.", "answerC": "the casting process takes more time than A. bellulus takes to construct a burrow.", "answerD": "the process of recovering the model distorts the resin\u2019s shape.", "correct": "B"}
